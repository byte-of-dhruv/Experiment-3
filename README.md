# Experiment-3

Aim - Learning Tuples inn python.

Theory - A tuple in Python is an ordered and immutable collection of elements used to store multiple values in a single variable. Tuples are defined using parentheses (), and elements inside a tuple can be of different data types such as integers, strings, and floating-point numbers.

Common tuple operations include accessing elements using index values, finding the length of a tuple, and using built-in functions such as len(), max(), min(), and count(). Tuples are widely used when data integrity is important.

Algorithm- Program to Demonstrate Tuple Commands in Python
1.Start
2.Create a tuple with required elements
3.Display the tuple using the print() function
4.Access tuple elements using index values
5.Perform tuple operations such as:
6.Finding length of the tuple
7.Accessing elements using slicing
8.Using built-in functions like count() or index()
9.Display the results using the print() function
10.Stop

Conclusion - We learned about different commands on tuples in python.
